In linguistic morphology and information retrieval stemming is the process of reducing inflected or sometimes derived words to their word stem base or root form generally a written word form 
The stem need not be identical to the morphological root of the word it is usually sufficient that related words map to the same stem even if this stem is not in itself a valid root caresses
Algorithms for stemming have been studied in computer science since the 1960s Many search engines treat words with the same stem as synonyms as a kind of query expansion a process called conflation
